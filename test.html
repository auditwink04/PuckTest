USING PUCK.JS FROM A WEB BLUETOOTH WEBSITE
Note: Web Bluetooth currently works on Mac OS, Android, Chromebook, Linux and iOS (with this app). Google should be adding Web Bluetooth support for Windows in early 2017.

To work, Web Bluetooth needs to be run from a website that's served over HTTPS (not HTTP). While you can set one up yourself with Let's Encrypt, we're not going to cover that here. Instead, we'll use GitHub Pages.

Log in or create an account on GitHub.com
Click on the Repositories tab, and click New
Enter PuckTest as the name, make sure you check Initialize this repository with a README, and click Create (if you don't, you'll have to use command-line tools to create a new file)
Click on Settings in the top right
Scroll down to GitHub Pages, under Source choose master branch and click Save
Now go back to the Code tab, and click Create new file in the top right
Enter test.html as the name
Now Copy and paste the following code and click Commit new file at the bottom:
<html>
 <head>
 </head>
 <body>
  <script src="https://www.puck-js.com/puck.js"></script>
  <button onclick="Puck.write('LED1.set();\n');">On!</button>
  <button onclick="Puck.write('LED1.reset();\n');">Off!</button>
 </body>
</html>
You'll now have your own webpage at: https://your_username.github.io/PuckTest/test.html



Click on the button marked On! and you should be presented with a window like the following:



If you choose your Puck.js device and click Pair, you should see the Red LED light up on it after a few seconds. You can now click the Off! button to turn it off, and it should turn off.

So what happened? The HTML above creates two buttons, and when they are executed they call the Puck.write function, which is in the puck.js script file that we loaded up right before.

Puck.write sends the string you pass to it directly to Puck.js as a command. You need the \n (newline character) to tell Espruino that it's the end of the command and it should execute it.

Can I send commands to Puck.js as soon as the page loads? Unfortunately not - as a security precaution, Web Bluetooth implementations can only connect to a Bluetooth LE device in response to user input. After that you can do what you want though.

The example above is pretty basic - let's try and make something that looks better.

First, we'll find a lightbulb icon. SVG is a nice choice as it looks good when it's scaled up, and we can include the whole image in our HTML file.

Go to materialdesignicons.com/
In the search box, type in lightbulb
Click the filled in icon, then in the window that pops up click </> and View SVG.
Copy the code that appears onto the clipboard
Now, go back to your repository on GitHub, click on the file, and click the edit icon (shaped like a Pencil).
Paste the SVG in right after the <body> tag.
If you view now, you should see a small lightbulb icon - but we want it to stretch, so we need to add some CSS to tell it to fill the available area. Add this inside the <head> tag:
  <style>
    body { margin:0;  }
    svg {
      display:block; position:absolute;
      top:0%; left:0%; width:100%; height:100%;
    }
  </style>
And delete the style= section from the SVG. Your code should now look like this:
<html>
 <head>
   <style>
     body { margin:0;  }
     svg {
       display:block; position:absolute;
       top:0%; left:0%; width:100%; height:100%;
     }
   </style>    
 </head>
 <body>
  <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path fill="#000000" d="M12,2A7,7 0 0,0 5,9C5,11.38 6.19,13.47 8,14.74V17A1,1 0 0,0 9,18H15A1,1 0 0,0 16,17V14.74C17.81,13.47 19,11.38 19,9A7,7 0 0,0 12,2M9,21A1,1 0 0,0 10,22H14A1,1 0 0,0 15,21V20H9V21Z" />
  </svg>
  <script src="https://www.puck-js.com/puck.js"></script>
  <button onclick="Puck.write('LED1.set();\n');">On!</button>
  <button onclick="Puck.write('LED1.reset();\n');">Off!</button>
 </body>
</html>
If you now reload your page it should look like this:


Note: if it doesn't change, it might be because the webpage has been cached. If you can add ?1 to the end of the URL (you may have to keep incrementing the number) it'll force a reload.

Now, we can start to make it interactive. We'll replace the two buttons with just a click on the SVG image.

Edit the code and replace the HTML for the buttons with a script that'll work when the image is clicked:
<html>
 <head>
   <style>
     body { margin:0;  }
     svg {
       display:block; position:absolute;
       top:0%; left:0%; width:100%; height:100%;
     }
   </style>    
 </head>
 <body>
  <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path fill="#000000" d="M12,2A7,7 0 0,0 5,9C5,11.38 6.19,13.47 8,14.74V17A1,1 0 0,0 9,18H15A1,1 0 0,0 16,17V14.74C17.81,13.47 19,11.38 19,9A7,7 0 0,0 12,2M9,21A1,1 0 0,0 10,22H14A1,1 0 0,0 15,21V20H9V21Z" />
  </svg>
  <script src="https://www.puck-js.com/puck.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Get the actual curve inside the SVG. You could make differemt
    // parts of a more complex SVG do different things...
    var path = document.getElementsByTagName('path')[0];
    // Make sure your mouse cursor turns into a hand when over it, and gray it out
    path.style="cursor:pointer;fill:#BBB";
    // Now send commands to turn the LED on or off
    var on = false;
    path.addEventListener("click", function() {
      on = !on;
      if (on) {
        path.style.fill="red";
        Puck.write('LED1.set();\n');
      } else {
        path.style.fill="#444";
        Puck.write('LED1.reset();\n');
      }
    });
  </script>
  </body>
 </html>
Save and reload the page and you should now be able to control the Puck's LED from it
Or course you might want to cycle through colours - in which case you could use the following:

<html>
 <head>
   <style>
     body { margin:0;  }
     svg {
       display:block; position:absolute;
       top:0%; left:0%; width:100%; height:100%;
     }
   </style>    
 </head>
 <body>
  <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path fill="#000000" d="M12,2A7,7 0 0,0 5,9C5,11.38 6.19,13.47 8,14.74V17A1,1 0 0,0 9,18H15A1,1 0 0,0 16,17V14.74C17.81,13.47 19,11.38 19,9A7,7 0 0,0 12,2M9,21A1,1 0 0,0 10,22H14A1,1 0 0,0 15,21V20H9V21Z" />
  </svg>
  <script src="https://www.puck-js.com/puck.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Get the actual curve inside the SVG. You could make differemt
    // parts of a more complex SVG do different things...
    var path = document.getElementsByTagName('path')[0];
    // Make sure your mouse cursor turns into a hand when over it, and gray it out
    path.style="cursor:pointer;fill:#BBB";
    // the possible states we could be in
    var state = 0;
    var states = [
      { color : "#444", command : "digitalWrite([LED3,LED2,LED1],0);\n" },
      { color : "red", command : "digitalWrite([LED3,LED2,LED1],1);\n" },
      { color : "green", command : "digitalWrite([LED3,LED2,LED1],2);\n" },
      { color : "blue", command : "digitalWrite([LED3,LED2,LED1],4);\n" },
    ];
    // Now send commands to turn the LED on or off
    path.addEventListener("click", function() {
      state++;
      if (state>=states.length)
        state=0;
      path.style.fill=states[state].color;
      Puck.write(states[state].command);
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
READING FROM PUCK.JS

At the moment, all we're doing is sending data to Puck.js - not getting anything back.

However, getting values back is quite easy. While you're connected to Puck.js with the webpage you made, open up the Developer tools in Chrome with Ctrl + Shift + I, F12, or from the menu (More tools -> Developer tools).

Now, enter the following in the Console window:

Puck.eval("BTN.read()",function(x) { console.log(x); })
This will print false to the console. However, if you press Puck.js down and do it again, it'll print true.

This is evaluating a command on Puck.js (note there's no newline needed), and then calling the callback with the result.

So why isn't this a normal function call that returns a value? Well, it takes time to send the data to Puck.js and get a response back. If your code waited for a response then the whole webpage would grind to a halt.

This way, you provide a function which is called back when data arrives, and everything else keeps working.

So how would you use this? You could modify the light example above to change the colour of the webpage icon depending on the amount of light the Puck can sense.

Just create a new HTML file in GitHub as you did above and paste the following code in:

<html>
 <head>
   <style>
     body { margin:0;  }
     svg {
       display:block; position:absolute;
       top:0%; left:0%; width:100%; height:100%;
     }
   </style>    
 </head>
 <body>
  <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path fill="#000000" d="M12,2A7,7 0 0,0 5,9C5,11.38 6.19,13.47 8,14.74V17A1,1 0 0,0 9,18H15A1,1 0 0,0 16,17V14.74C17.81,13.47 19,11.38 19,9A7,7 0 0,0 12,2M9,21A1,1 0 0,0 10,22H14A1,1 0 0,0 15,21V20H9V21Z" />
  </svg>
  <script src="https://www.puck-js.com/puck.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Get the actual curve inside the SVG. You could make differemt
    // parts of a more complex SVG do different things...
    var path = document.getElementsByTagName('path')[0];
    // Make sure your mouse cursor turns into a hand when over it, and gray it out
    path.style="cursor:pointer;fill:#BBB";

    function getLightValue() {
      Puck.eval("Puck.light()", function(v) {
        path.style.fill="rgb("+Math.round(v*255)+",0,0)";
        setTimeout(function() {
          getLightValue();
        }, 250);
      });
    }

    // When clicked, start trying to get the light value
    path.addEventListener("click", function() {
      getLightValue();
    });
  </script>
 </body>
</html>
Now, when you click the light bulb it'll connect to Puck.js, and you can change the colour by shining light on or covering up your Puck.

Note: we're only requesting new data after we have got the last set of data. This is better than using something like setInterval, as if there are transmission errors, multiple requests for data could end up piling up.

This works, and it's easy - but it's not very fast.

TWO WAY COMMUNICATIONS

What would be better is if we had lower-level control. We could then just tell Espruino to automatically send data over Bluetooth (without being prompted) and we could just handle it directly.

That's what you can do with Puck.connect(callback). Once connected it calls the callback function with the connection, which you can then use to send and receive data.

Try the example below:

<html>
 <head>
   <style>
     body { margin:0;  }
     svg {
       display:block; position:absolute;
       top:0%; left:0%; width:100%; height:100%;
     }
   </style>    
 </head>
 <body>
  <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path fill="#000000" d="M12,2A7,7 0 0,0 5,9C5,11.38 6.19,13.47 8,14.74V17A1,1 0 0,0 9,18H15A1,1 0 0,0 16,17V14.74C17.81,13.47 19,11.38 19,9A7,7 0 0,0 12,2M9,21A1,1 0 0,0 10,22H14A1,1 0 0,0 15,21V20H9V21Z" />
  </svg>
  <script src="https://www.puck-js.com/puck.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Get the actual curve inside the SVG. You could make differemt
    // parts of a more complex SVG do different things...
    var path = document.getElementsByTagName('path')[0];
    // Make sure your mouse cursor turns into a hand when over it, and gray it out
    path.style="cursor:pointer;fill:#BBB";

    // Called when we get a line of data - updates the light color
    function onLine(v) {
      console.log("Received: "+JSON.stringify(v));
      path.style.fill="rgb("+Math.round(v*255)+",0,0)";
    }

    // When clicked, connect or disconnect
    var connection;
    path.addEventListener("click", function() {
      if (connection) {
        connection.close();
        connection = undefined;
      }
      Puck.connect(function(c) {
        if (!c) {
          alert("Couldn't connect!");
          return;
        }
        connection = c;
        // Handle the data we get back, and call 'onLine'
        // whenever we get a line
        var buf = "";
        connection.on("data", function(d) {
          buf += d;
          var i = buf.indexOf("\n");
          while (i>=0) {
            onLine(buf.substr(0,i));
            buf = buf.substr(i+1);
            i = buf.indexOf("\n");
          }
        });
        // First, reset Puck.js
        connection.write("reset();\n", function() {
          // Wait for it to reset itself
          setTimeout(function() {
            // Now tell it to write data on the current light level to Bluetooth
            // 10 times a second
            connection.write("setInterval(function(){Bluetooth.println(Puck.light());},100);\n",
              function() { console.log("Ready..."); });
          }, 1500);
        });
      });
    });
  </script>
 </body>
</html>
This:

Connects when the light is clicked
Registers a data handler with connection.on("data", ...), which then calls onLine each time a line is received.
Sends reset() to Puck.js - while not required this performs a software reset, which would clear out any previously send code.
Waits for the reset to complete. The reset is fast, but sending the text created bythe reset itself is slow!
Sends setInterval(function(){Bluetooth.println(Puck.light());},100); - this causes Espruino to write the current light value down the Bluetooth link every 100ms.
When each line is received, onLine gets called and it updates the color of the light icon.
Note: We use Bluetooth.println not console.log because writing to the console would cause the > prompt character to be removed, the text to be written, and then > to be written again. By writing direct to Bluetooth the console device is unaware of what's going on and doesn't output any extra characters.

Warning: Even when disconnected, Puck.js will still be executing setInterval which will cause your battery to drain much more quickly than if it was idle. The best way to fix this would be to add an event handler to the NRF class that cleared all intervals when the connection was dropped.
